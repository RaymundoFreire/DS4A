    "[Python](https://docs.python.org/3/) is an [interpreted, high-level general programming language](https://www.webopedia.com/TERM/O/object_oriented_programming_OOP.html) that was first released in 1991. Python allows users to easily manipulate data and store values in what are known as <b>objects</b>. Everything in Python is an object and has a <b>type</b>. For example, if a user aims to store the integer 5 in an object named ```my_int```, this can be accomplished by the statement, ```my_int = 5```. This statement tells Python to assign the integer value of 5 to the **variable** ```my_int``` (called a variable here because it can change value). ```my_int``` is a Python object, and has type ```int```.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similar to how Excel distinguishes different data types (such as Text, Number, Currency, Scientific), Python offers a variety of data types. Here are a few common data types:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Integers, type ```int```: ```my_int = 1```\n",
    "2. Float type ```float```: ```my_float = 25.5```\n",
    "3. Strings, type ```str```: ```my_string = 'Hello'```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we see (1) <b>integers</b> and (2) <b>floats</b> store numeric data.  The difference between the two is that floats store decimal variables, whereas the integer type can only store integer variables. (3) is the <b>string</b> type. Strings are used to store textual data in Python. This case will use string variables to store country names. They are often used to store identifiers such as person names, city names, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are other data types available in Python; however, these are the three fundamental types that you will see across almost every Python program. Always keep in mind that **every** object in Python has a type and some of these \"types\" can be custom-defined by the user, which is one of the benefits of Python.\n",

Each estimate here is a number (float) between 0 and 1, inclusive, which represents the probability that expanding to that country will be successful.\n",

In ```success_estimates``` below, the list contains float types. Lists are versatile and can be expanded by adding new elements to the end of the list (the right-most side is considered the end of the list). Moreover, list elements (i.e. the objects in the list) can be accessed easily using integer indices. Interestingly, lists can also store other lists (called a lists of lists).

Hence, the `for` loop statement will iterate over all the elements of the list ```[1,2,3,4]```, and at each iteration it updates the iterator variable ```i``` to the next value in the list ```[1,2,3,4]```. In `for` loops, it is an extremely good habit to choose an iterator variable that provides context rather than a random letter. In this case, we will use both to get you accustomed to both since you will mostly likely see both throughout the course of your data science career, but we encourage you to not use a generic name like `i` whenever possible for ease of communication.\n",

    "Let's take a closer look at the above ```for``` loop. The ```country_name_list``` has 15 countries which the ```for``` loop is iterating over. The ```for``` loop uses a placeholder variable, denoted ```i``` in this case, to store the element of ```country_name_list``` that each loop iteration corresponds to. Namely, for the first iteration of the ```for``` loop, ```i = 'Brazil'```. For the second iteration, ```i = 'Canada'```. And so on until the loop reaches the final element of ```country_name_list```, which it then completes and exits the looping process.\n",
