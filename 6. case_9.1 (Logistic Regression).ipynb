    "During the case study, you will be introduced to logistic regression as a means to test a hypothesis. You will then go on to validate this hypothesis by turning the logistic regression into a classifier and measuring its performance. Understanding the theory and interpretation of logistic regression is a vital tool in the data science domain, especially in classification."

    "**Business Context.** Online peer-to-peer (P2P) lending has made the practice of borrowing and lending easy. In this form of lending, there is no in-person interview and a borrower can simply fill out an online form and get a loan approved. The information provided solely by a borrower is prone to exaggeration and distortion, especially when it comes to income. Every P2P lending company relies on a well-designed procedure that rejects borrowers with a high chance of not paying off their debts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Rejecting anyone without a verified source of income is a relevant policy that lending platforms can roll out to help reduce the rate of bad loans. It is natural to suspect that if a person's income source cannot be verified, then they might default on the loan. However, from the perspective of a borrower, the verification process can be cumbersome and time-consuming and they may just switch to another platform due to this inconvenience. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Business Problem.** As a data scientist at an emerging P2P lending company, you must answer the following question: **\"Should the company verify the income source of an online loan applicant before approving their loan?\"**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Analytical Context.** The data is downloaded from [LendingClub (LC) Statistics](https://www.lendingclub.com/info/download-data.action) and it contains all loans issued from 2007 - 2012 along with their current loan status (fully paid or charged off). There are ~50 variables that describe the borrowers and the loans; for the sake of reducing complexity, the company has already performed a pre-screening of these variables based on existing analyses from LendingClub to select nine relevant variables, such as annual income, LendingClub credit grade, home ownership, etc. We will use a new technique, **logistic regression**, to answer our question at hand.\n",
    "\n",
    "The case is structured as follows, you will:\n",
    " 1. explore the existing data to get a rough idea of how each variable in the dataset interacts with the current loan status\n",
    " 2. look at potential confounding effects\n",
    " 3. learn the basics of logistic regression models; and finally\n",
    " 4. fit a series of logistic regression models to determine whether or not verifying income source is significant."

On the other hand, the stratum-specific probability of full payment is quite different from stratum to stratum.\n",

We can see the users with no verified income have many more short-term loans, while the stratified contigency table told us that users with longer loan terms are less likely to pay off their debts compared to short-term loan borrowers."

We observed from the contingency table that this probability increases when the information about income becomes less reliable. However, this observation cannot be verified with just the standard chi-square test.\n",

    "We introduce the logistic regression model to examine if this trend is significant. The logistic regression model is a modified version of the standard linear regression model that deals with classification problems, where the outcomes are binary variables (in this case, whether the loan was paid off or charged off). To understand a logistic regression model, let's first introduce the idea of **odds**. The odds of an event is the ratio of its success probability to its failure probability. In our case, the odds of fully paying the debt is defined as\n",

We assert that this coding scheme implies that if $\\beta_1$ is positive, then there is an increasing trend of pay-off probability as income verification status becomes more reliable. On the other hand, if $\\beta_1$ is negative, the opposite is true."

If $\\beta_1$ is significantly different from zero, we can use the estimated sign of $\\beta_1$ to determine the direction of the trend.\n",

Remember that the goal of our whole analysis is to predict whether or not a user is going to pay off his debt. But how do we evaluate if the predication is accurate or not? This question is not as simple as it seems and the reason is because logistic models only produce probabilities while what we observed are binary labels.\n",

We can further summarize the whole ROC cruve by the **area under the curve (AUC)**. Roughly speaking, AUC indicates the probability that a randomly selected defaulter will have smaller $p$ than a randomly selected non-defaulter.\n",
    "\n",
    "If AUC is close to one, the rule is close to a perfect rule. The ROC curve for a random guess rule (set $p$ to 0.5 for all applicants) is the diagonal line in the plot and usually serves as a baseline to check if the logistic model learns any information from the data above and beyond pure randomness. The ROC curves of the above two logistic regression models are shown below:"

    "From the figure we find that both ROCs have AUCs quite close to 0.5, confirming that `verification_status` alone is not very predictive of loan status above and beyond random guessing. This also confirms that the first coding scheme has identical performance to the second coding scheme. Since the first coding scheme is more parsimonious (i.e. contains fewer parameters) than the second scheme, we will use the first coding scheme for the rest of this analysis."

    "Based on the results above (pseudo $R^2$ and AUCs), what can we conclude about the appropriate code scheme for `verification_status`?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer.** There is no difference in the two metrics when comparing the two different coding schemes. In statistics, we prefer simple models and therefore the first coding scheme is appropriate. Note that in the second coding scheme, we need to estimate one more parameter than in the first coding scheme."

    "In the previous section, we verified that there is indeed a decreasing trend in pay-off probability associated with more reliable income information. We also performed two model-checking approaches and determined that the integer coding for `verification_status` is adequate. Yet the discovered decreasing trend is counterintuitive. This might be because many other factors are also associated with the probability of pay-off as we have seen in the exploratory analyses. Similar to linear regression, not accounting for these factors will result in completely different answers for the effect of `verification_status`, which is already hinted at in the stratified contingency tables."

    "We find that except for `annual_inc`, all other variables in the dataset are correlated with `verification_status`. For example, there seems to be a strong correlation between `verification_status` and `loan_amnt`. People with no verified income source tend to borrow less money than people with verified income source. This might be the reason for the decreasing trend associated with `verification_status`, since smaller loans are more likely to be paid off. Let's now incorporate all these variables (including `annual_inc` for now) into the logistic model along with `verification_status` and see if the decreasing trend associated with `verification_status` is still present:"

    "In this case, we investigated whether the verification status of applicants' income source is important when predicting if an applicant will pay off his/her debt. We constructed a logistic model to first examine the marginal relationship between verification status and probability of pay-off. We discovered a counterintuitive trend: less reliable income source information was correlated with higher pay-off probability. However, after fitting a larger logistic model with all independent variables that were available, we found that this trend was introduced via confounding effects of interest rate, annual income, and loan term.\n",
    "\n",
    "After accounting for these variables, verification status was no longer significantly associated with pay-off probability. Based on $p$-values and the model ROC, we concluded that the verification process is irrelevant and we could potentially remove it from the required items and simplify the lending process."

    "Logistic regression is only one of many different tools used in classification. While simple, it performs fairly well and needs relatively little data to train compared to other, more modern classifiers. While we only studied the binary case, there are extensions of logistic regression to handle multi-class and ordinal regression as well (you can read up on these in your own time)."
