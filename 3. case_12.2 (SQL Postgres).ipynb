    "**Business Context.** You are a data scientist at a new but fast-growing startup. The startup released its first product 12 months ago and has been tracking Net Promoter Score (NPS) over its growing customer base since the product's launch.\n",
    "\n",
    "The team assumes that the NPS score is correlated to the product stability and feature-completeness and that the product has been getting more stable and complete over time. They also realize that there have been some hiccups along the way, and they assume that NPS has therefore fluctuated up and down.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Business Problem.** The startup wants you to investigate the data and answering the following question: **\"Has our NPS improved over time? And has our average NPS decreased in specific periods over the last 12 months?\"**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Analytical Context.** In this case, you will be working with a dataset that the startup has been storing since the beginning. They decided to use a ```PostgreSQL``` database because it offered advanced statistical functions. As it is a startup, they've only have enough funds to give you a computation limited machine but their database server is very good. You'll have to connect to the ```PostgreSQL``` database and have the database run the resource-intensive queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically, you will: (1) get familiarized with what NPS is and some of its properties; (2) set up a PostgreSQL on your local machine and import the given dataset into it; (3) use advanced SQL features to calculate NPS and NPS statistics."

    "NPS is a metric to measure customer satisfaction. You've probably seen pop-ups online, or received surveys via email, asking you \"Would you recommend [product] to a friend or family member?\" and giving you the option to respond with a number between 0 and 10. That's someone collecting information to calculate their NPS.\n",
    "\n",
    "![nps Example Survey](images/nps-example-survey.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic idea is simple - customers who respond with high ratings are more likely to promote your product to other potential customers. Customers who give low ratings are unhappy and are unlikely to help you grow your customer base. If you ask enough people at different time periods, you can track customer satisfaction over time and see how this correlates to product development and other aspects of your business that are within your control. \n",
    "\n",
    "NPS categorizes users into three groups based on the ratings that they leave. This is done as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Users who leave a rating of 0 - 6 are regarded as \"detractors\"\n",
    "2. Users who leave a rating of 7 or 8 are regarded as \"passives\"\n",
    "3. Users who leave a rating of 9 or 10 are regarded as \"promoters\"\n",
    "\n",
    "The final NPS score for a given period is calculated as the percentage of total users who are promoters minus the percentage of total users who are detractors. This means that an NPS score can be anything from -100 to 100."

    "In this case, we are going to use PostgreSQL because it is easy to install and because it is open-source. As you become more proficient with SQL, you can try the non-commercial version of SQL Server as it offers a lot of advanced features as well as an excellent tool to manage the database (SQL Server Management Studio), and furthermore it is very likely that your organization has a SQL Server database laying around. In later cases, we will also use Amazon RDS in order to work with databases in-cloud.\n",

    "Of course, we can do the calculation manually to see the results because we only have 12 months in this example. However, we want to make this process automated. We can ```JOIN``` these two tables and do the desired calculation. Before we do that, you may have noticed that these SQL statements are getting a bit unwieldly. The fact that these queries have identical inner ```SELECT```'s means we can share that across both queries so that our ```JOIN``` becomes more compact. This is accomplished by making a ```VIEW``` with the ```WITH ... AS``` syntax where you can essentially save a subquery as a variable."

    "In this case, you learned about the Net Promoter Score (NPS) metric. You set up a local PostgreSQL database. You also learned how to write complex queries in SQL that could be run directly in the database. These queries used advanced features like nested `SELECT` statements and `CASE` statements which can be combined in intricate ways to get the results you need directly from your database. They also leveraged PostgreSQL exclusive aggregate functions like ```regr_slope``` to do direct basic statistical analysis.\n",

    "We found that there was a general increase in NPS over time; however, starting in September there was a significant downturn in average NPS score. It is likely that the product encountered some significant bugs or outages during this time and going forward we should check if anything was recorded by the startup's product team to confirm this."

    "Cloud databases are a powerful and scalable way to analyze data if you have constraints on processor, memory or storage resources for your local hardware. You can do all sorts of things in-cloud that you could originally only do on your local machine, such as run complex SQL queries directly against a cloud database. Although SQL is often seen as \"simple\" and discarded in favor of new-age languages like Python, basic SQL building blocks, such as `SELECT`, `WHERE`, and `CASE` can be joined to build up sophisticated queries that are highly efficient in comparison to trying to do the same thing in Python."
