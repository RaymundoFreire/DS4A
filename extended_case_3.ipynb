We then built on these queries ```JOIN```ing them across many tables to be able to perform some basically statistical analysis. We found both unsurprising (commission correlated with total sales) and surprising (different subcategories have different +/- correlation between total sales of products and price). However, the main skill you should takeway is seeing how databases are normally structured and getting practice navigating a new dataset using only the documentation provided."
